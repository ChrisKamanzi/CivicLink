# Citizen Engagement System


A Flutter-based platform powered by AI, enabling citizens to voice their concerns while allowing government departments to respond efficiently and transparently.

* Submitted for: HANGA HUB Hackathon 

# Project Overview

The Citizen Engagement System is a mobile-first solution built to bridge the communication gap between citizens and government agencies.  By leveraging an advanced AI model, users can submit complaints effortlesslyâ€”simply typing their concerns, while the model automatically detects and assigns the appropriate ministry. Administrators benefit from an intuitive dashboard to manage submissions, respond promptly, and ensure transparency in issue resolution.

This project was developed within the time constraints of the Hackathon.

# Problem Statement: 

Many citizens face challenges in voicing concerns to government institutions, including:

Lack of a streamlined, transparent system for submitting complaints.

Poor tracking and feedback on submitted issues.

Manual handling of reports by government departments.

# Our Solution
 
We developed an AI-powered mobile application to transform the complaint-handling process:

* Users can submit complaints through a simple interface, with AI automatically identifying the relevant government ministry.

 * Admin View: Enables admins to view categorized complaints, assign statuses, and respond directly to users.
