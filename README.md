# Citizen Engagement System


A Flutter-based platform empowering citizens to voice their concerns, and helping government departments respond effectively.

* Submitted for: HANGA HUB Hackathon 

# Project Overview

The Citizen Engagement System is a mobile-first solution built to bridge the communication gap between citizens and government agencies. It enables users to submit complaints or feedback digitally, while giving administrators an intuitive dashboard to manage and respond to these submissions.

This project was developed within the time constraints of the Hackathon.

# Problem Statement: 

Many citizens face challenges in voicing concerns to government institutions, including:

Lack of a streamlined, transparent system for submitting complaints.

Poor tracking and feedback on submitted issues.

Manual handling of reports by government departments.

# Our Solution
 
I developed a two-sided mobile app:

* Citizen View: Allows users to submit detailed complaints, including department/category selection, images, and tracking progress.

 * Admin View: Enables admins to view categorized complaints, assign statuses, and respond directly to users.

* The UI is simple, fast, and leverages orange as a primary theme color for clarity and energy.

 # Features
 
  For Citizens (Users):
   
* Submit complaints or feedback with category and description

* Track complaint status (Pending, Resolved, etc.)

* View admin replies

 For Admins:
 
* View complaints filtered by department

* Reply to citizen complaints

* Status management and real-time updates

* Secure logout functionality
